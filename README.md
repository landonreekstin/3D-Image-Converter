# 3D-Image-Converter

Converts a 2D image and creates a 3D render which can be rotated using a web browser client. 

Extracts the individual pixels from a chosen 2D image and represents that image in a 3D space using the pixels brightness as the z coordinate. The ability to rotate the camera around this 3D image is added.
